        <p>In November 2020, Portland passed a new ordinance to limit increases in rent. The purpose of the ordinance is to promote community stability and protect tenants, while ensuring landlords receive a fair return on investment. Full text of the ordinance can be found
          <a href="https://www.portlandmaine.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1070/Chapter-6-Buildings-and-Building-Regulations---Revised-1132020" target="_BLANK">here</a>.</p>

        <p>This calculator is a resource to help tenants and landlords calculate the new allowed yearly rent increase for their unit(s).</p>

          <p>* Base Rent is the amount of monthly rent charged as of June 2020.</p>
          <p>* AIP is based on the change in the Consumer Price Index for Greater Boston Metro Area, as published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-england/news-release/consumerpriceindex_boston.htm" target="_BLANK">United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. The City of Portland's Housing Safety Office will publish an updated AIP each year on September 1, beginning September 1, 2021.</p>

          <p>* Increase Amount and New Total represent the calculated basic allowable increase after multiplying the inputed Base Rent amount by the current AIP.</p>
          <p>* New Total may not reflect the full yearly increase allowed. Factors such as Tax Rate Adjustment, new tenancy, Banked Rent, and Rent Board approved improvements to the unit may each have an impact on the allowed increase. See Section 6-234 of the <a href="https://www.portlandmaine.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1070/Chapter-6-Buildings-and-Building-Regulations---Revised-1132020" target="_BLANK">Ordinance</a> for full details.</p>
          <p>* The combined total of allowed increase(s) is capped at 10% per year; amounts above 10% may be "banked" for the following year. See Section 6-235 for more on banking rent increases.</p>
