        <p>In November 2020, Portland passed a new ordinance to limit increases in rent. The purpose of the ordinance is to promote community stability and protect tenants, while ensuring landlords receive a fair return on investment.</p>

        <p>Landlords and tenants can use this tool to calculate their unit’s allowable rent increase.</p>

        <p>Full text of the ordinance can be found here. It is Article XII, which covers sections 6-230 to 6-243. The City of Portland has a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the ordinance here.</p>

        <p>NOTE: The Rent Stabilization Ordinance covers only units within city limits, and do not meet certain exemptions, such as schools or small owner-occupied properties. See the FAQ, or Section 6-231, for a full list of exemptions.</p>

          <h4>Input Base Rent:</h4>
          <p>INPUT BOX GOES HERE</p>
        </div>
        <p class="help-text">*Base rent is the amount of rent charged as of June 2020. Base rent may also be adjusted in a few special circumstances, such as after a renovation. See Section 6-233 for more on those special cases.</p>
        <p><span>The currently reported increase percentage is XX%.</span> The Housing Safety Office publishes the Allowable Increase Percentage (AIP) each year on September 1. There are a few situations where a Landlord may increase rent beyond the AIP, such as at the start of a new tenant, or after capital improvements to the unit. See Section 6-234 for full details.</p>
