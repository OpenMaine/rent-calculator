# Documentation
... is a good idea.  The `docs` folder has a template [Tech Spec](/docs/Tech_Spec.md) and [Best Practices](/docs/Best_Practices.md) document, ready to be filled in.  Other documents and relevant information that has no other place can also live in the `docs` folder.  Update this section as docs are added.  

For now, we've got two Google Docs holding the outline of the website (includes intro, how user will flow through, calculator, etc) and acceptance criteria:

# Setup
We're going for a simple one page website, so only set up needed should be a text editor for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
Tasks for completing this project are in the "projects" tab.  

# Using this product
As a landlord, I know that I can no longer raise rents past the amount the city sets each year. But how can I make improvements to my property? I need to figure out my costs and get a sense of how to pay for everything.

As a citizen who recently voted for the rent stabilization ordinance, I want to make sure that the program is running effectively and that the rent board is helping landlords comply with the law.

# Testing
... is also a good idea.  More info needed here.
